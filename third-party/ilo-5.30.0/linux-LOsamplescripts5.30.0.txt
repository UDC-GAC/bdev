    A valid iLO user account and password is required for each
    XML script when using LOCFG or HPQLOCFG. The user account must have
    appropriate lights-out privileges to process the request.

    The locfg.pl script connects to the iLO management processor
    using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection.

perl locfg.pl -s {servername|ipaddress}[:port] [-l logfile] -f input_file [-u username -p password] [-ilo3|-ilo4|-ilo5]

 Where:
        -s servername is the DNS name of target server.
        -s ipaddress is the IP Address of the target server.
           If a port is not specified, the port will default to :443.
                DO NOT USE this switch if launching from System Insight Manager.

        -l logfile is the name of the file to log all output to.
           A default file with the server name/ipaddress is created
           if this option is not specified.
                DO NOT USE this switch if launching from System Insight Manager.

        -f input_file is the filename containing the RIB Commands
        -u username
        -p password  Command line user name and password override those
           which are in the script file.
           Note: Use -u and -p with caution as command line options are visible on Linux.
        -ilo3|-ilo4|ilo5
           Specifies the type of device on the server. 
           Note: locfg.pl detects the device automatically if this option is not present.

Using vspconfig.pl
   This script will modify the following two files:
        \etc\inittab
        \etc\securetty

    usage: vspconfig.pl [-h] -t [0|1|2|3] 
          
          -h    : This help message
          -t    : Specify terminal (ttyS)
