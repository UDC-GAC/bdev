DESCRIPTION:  
	This is a set of sample XML script used to manage the configuration of Lights-Out
      management processors and to control servers in which the following devices are in use:
                  	Integrated Lights-Out 4
                  	Integrated Lights-Out 3
                  	Integrated Lights-Out 2  
 
Note:	
	Use CPQLOCFG.EXE ver 4.20 or greater (with iLO2), or HPQLOCFG.EXE ver 1.00 or greater (with 1LO3 and iLO4) as well as locfg.pl ver 4.10 or greater with these scripts.

   A valid iLO user account and password is required for each
   XML script when using CPQLOCFG or HPQLOCFG.  The user account must have
   appropriate lights-out privileges to process the request.

   The locfg.pl script connects to the iLO management processor
   using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection.

perl locfg.pl -s {servername|ipaddress}[:port] [-l logfile] -f input_file [-u username -p password] [-ilo2|-ilo3]

 Where:
        -s servername is the DNS name of target server.
        -s ipaddress is the IP Address of the target server.
           If a port is not specified, the port will default to :443.
                DO NOT USE this switch if launching from System Insight Manager.

        -l logfile is the name of the file to log all output to.
           A default file with the server name/ipaddress is created
           if this option is not specified.
                DO NOT USE this switch if launching from System Insight Manager.

        -f input_file is the filename containing the RIB Commands
        -u username
        -p password  Command line user name and password override those
           which are in the script file.
           Note: Use -u and -p with caution as command line options are visible on Linux.
        -ilo2|-ilo3|-ilo4
           Specifies the type of device on the server. 
           Note: locfg.pl detects the device automatically if this option is not present.

Using vspconfig.pl
   This script will modify the following two files:
		\etc\inittab
		\etc\securetty

    usage: vspconfig.pl [-h] -t [0|1|2|3] 
          
          -h 	: This help message
          -t	: Specify terminal (ttyS)
