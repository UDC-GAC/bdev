PEGASUS is a Peta-scale graph mining system on hadoop, fully written in Java.
It calculates the degree distribution, PageRank, RWR(Random Walk with Restart) scores, radii/diameter, and connected components of very large graphs with more than billions of nodes and edges.
The details of PEGASUS can be found in the following paper:

U Kang, Charalampos E. Tsourakakis, and Christos Faloutsos. 
PEGASUS: A Peta-Scale Graph Mining System - Implementation and Observations. 
IEEE International Conference On Data Mining 2009, Miami, Florida, USA.
